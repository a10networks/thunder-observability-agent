## UC_01 - COLLECT_LOG_METRIC_FROM_THUNDER_IN_AWS_&_PUBLISH_IN_AWS_CLOUD-WATCH
    - Use Cases : 01
    - Scenario  : Collect metrics and logs from thunder/thunders running in aws environment and publish it into aws-cloudwatch.
    
    - Description : Borse Inc is regular a10 client. Company purchased an instance of thunder long back and deployed it on AWS platform,
         This instance is configured as ADC server load balancer for there gaming applications named 
         [Pokers and Football] in two partitions named POKERS and FOOTBALL,
         and from past few months company is getting timeout/fail-over complain from there online gaming customers. 
         These generally happened on occasions/event/festival/holidays due to high traffic load on thunder.
         Company wants a standard way to monitor all 14 metrics and logs generated by a thunder on AWS cloudwatch service 
         and want to get email alert notifications when aggregated cpu usage crosses 75% threshold value so that proper 
         action can be taken on time.
    
    - Company has some shared environment with some hardware space leftover with below information:
        - Linux Environment IP : 10.22.32.51
