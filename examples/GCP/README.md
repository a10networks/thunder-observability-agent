# GCP EXAMPLE USE-CASES

## UC_01 - COLLECT_LOG_METRIC_FROM_THUNDER_&_PUBLISH_IN_GCP
    - Use Cases : 01
    - Scenario  : Collect metrics and logs from thunder/thunders and publish it into gcp.
    
    - Description : JKQ Corp. is regular a10 client. Company purchased an instance of thunder long back and deployed it on some cloud platform,
    
         This instance is configured as ADC server load balancer for there gaming applications named [Baseball]
         and from past few months company is getting timeout/fail-over complain from there online gaming customers. 
         These generally happened on occasions/event/festival/holidays due to high traffic load on thunder.
         Company wants a standard way to monitor all 14 metrics and logs generated by a thunder on gcp.
         Also want to get email alert notifications when aggregated cpu usage crosses 75% threshold value so that proper 
         action can be taken on time.
      
    - Company has some shared environment with some hardware space leftover with below information:
        - Linux Environment IP : 10.22.32.51
        - Hardware 			: 2GB RAM, 1CPU, 4GB memory.
    
    - Company has below thunder environment details:
        - Thunder IP: 10.22.32.01
        - User Name : Online_Baseball_TH
        - Password : Thunder@JKQ@2828
        - Resource_Id : i-1234567890lmnopq0
    
    - Company has shared gcp credentials
        - gcp_project_id = jkq-public-396315
        - gcp_service_key_path = C:/Users/Desktop/keyFolder/jkq-public-396315-db3b0f.json
    
    - Solution : A10 support team suggested to install 'Thunder Observability Agent[TOA]' within a cloud platform.
        It's pretty straight forward and super easy.
